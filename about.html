    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>I'm Danny, a student at Dominican University studying Computer Science and Information Systems.
    I'm currently learning more about software development and I'm excited to share my projects with you.
    </p>
    <p>I've always had a passion for technology as far as I can remember. Whether it was trying to recreate Tony Stark's gadgets as a kid or 
        researching what to buy for my first ever phone, tech has always been prominent in my life. 
        I hope to share my passion with the world especially with my friends and family. 
    </p>
    <p>My goal is to work with the front end as well as in UI/UX design. This enthusiasm strikes me due to my parents. As I've begun technifying my life over the years
        I've noticed how much of an impact it has on my life and people's lives. I've attempted to influence my parents however I've noticed how confusing it must be 
        for a generation that didn't grow up with technology. Even start-up pages seem intimidating by throwing words most people are hearing for the first time in their lives.
        My goal is to make technology easier to use by providing a minimal and efficient interface. So that all of our loved ones may enjoy technology despite educational, language, and cultural barriers.
    </p>
